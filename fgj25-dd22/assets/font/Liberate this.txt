Everything in this text file was typed from left to right by Apostrophe, who is the same person who made the fonts that prompted you to download this file in the first place, which means that you are obliged to consider him a creative genius, applaud his every move, create a mental image of him, visualize him as your imaginary friend, mention him in your prayers, and smile while shaking your head at the memory of his name when you're drunk. If you do not comply with the creator's aforementioned requests, you are not allowed to use this font in any way. It is the creator's wish that you go sit on the toilet and ponder the possibilities of life on other planets in exactly 7 minutes, otherwise no font for you. Also no font for you if you sleep less more than 5 hours a day.
